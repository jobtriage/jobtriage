# Job Triage  
### Interactive way to manage your Job application
Made with Rails, React, Mongo DB and :purple_heart:

**Note** : This is still in beta version and there may be some issues. Please raise them as github issues.

## Development :rocket:

### server

 - Install the gems using `bundle install`
 - Start mongodb server in local as you prefered
 - Start server using `rails s`
 - Test server using `rails test`
 - Check the [API doc here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3705194/SzKWuxaB?version=latest)

Note: You can find mongodb server details in `/config/mongoid.yml`. You don't have to change anything in that file.

### client

 - `cd frontend`
 - `yarn install`
 - `yarn start`
 -  Open http://localhost:3001 or any port at which React starts
